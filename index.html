        <h1>Microsoft</h1>

            <span>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation which produces computer
                software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services headquarted at the Microsoft
                Redmond campus located in Redmond, Washington, United States. Its best-known software products are the
                Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web
                browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface
                lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of
                the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[3] it was the world's largest software maker by
                revenue as of 2016.[4] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside
                Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta.

                Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"[5]) was founded by Bill Gates and
                Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to
                dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by
                Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price,
                created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the
                1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of
                corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December
                2016,[6] followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[7]

                As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office
                software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to
                Android.[8] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for
                desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital
                services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software
                development (Visual Studio).</span>
